# Sales-Prediction-and-Classification-Models

## Project Objective
Amazon is an American multinational technology company based in Seattle, United States. Amazon currently focuses on e-Commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence. The company hosts approximately 1,000,000,000 gigabytes of data on over 1,400,000 servers. As one of the companies with a significant e-Commerce business, Amazon is at high risk of retail fraud. The company uses machine learning algorithms to find transactions with a higher probability of fraud. This proactive action has helped the company limit clients with excessive product returns. Create a prediction model for the amount of transactions and a classification model for the type of transactions and determine the best model among the resulting models.
